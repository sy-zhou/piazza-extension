# Piazza++

A Chrome extension which modifies Piazza's default styling to give the website a more modern and user-friendly design. Improves on colour theming and adds some customization features. This project was inspired by similar efforts made on WaterlooWorks and Learn.

If you would like to try it out, feel free to download this repo and load the unpacked extension through Chrome's developer mode!
